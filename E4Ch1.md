## A. Introduction to biotechnology  
- Definition: Technological applications that involve the use of organisms/biological systems/processes to produces goods/provide services  
- Modern biotech:  
	- Knowledge of heredity and microorganisms  
	- Discovery of DNA structure  
	- Manipulation of DNA/cells/tissues  
- Examples  
	- Production of cheese/wine (early biotech)  
	- Selective breeding  
## B. Recombinant DNA technology  
	- Steps  
		1. Obtain DNA fragments containing gene of interest from target cell  
		   [Extract DNA encoding human insulin from human pancreatic cell]  

		2. Obtain vectors (e.g. plasmids)  
		   [Extract plasmid with antibiotic resistance gene from bacterium]

		3. Cut DNA fragments and plasmids using restriction enzyme (Restriction)
		   [Cut at specific locations that create sticky ends, i.e. outstanding bases, such that sticky ends from DNA fragment/plasmid are complementary to each other]
		   {Cut at locations that are not the target gene/antibiotic resistance gene}

		4. Join DNA fragment/plasmid together using DNA ligase (Ligation)
		   [DNA ligase catalyses joining of DNA fragment/plasmid by **covalent bonds**]
		   [New plasmid called recombinant plasmid]
		   {Recombinant plasmid introduced into host cells for replication and expression}

	- Example: Production of human insulin using recombinant plasmids
	    - *E. coli* commonly used as host cell.
	- Mix  *E. coli* with recombinant plasmids
	    - Some  *E. coli* receive recombinant plasmid (transformed bacterium)
	    - Transformed bacteria have antibiotic resistance gene (selective marker)
	- Place all bacteria on agar plate containing an antibiotic
	    - Bacteria without recombinant plasmid have no antibiotic resistance gene, therefore die
	    - Transformed bacterium survive and divide
	- Colonies of transformed bacteria are formed
	    - Cultured in fermenters
	- Recombinant plasmid
	    - Replicates in cell
	    - Copied to daughter cells
	        - Results in many copies of target, i.e. DNA encoding human insulin (gene cloning)
        	- Expressed and polypeptides are produced
        	    - Extracted and processed into functional human insulin
	- Advantages of recombinant DNA technology (Human insulin production)
	    - Insulin produced is structurally the same as that produced by human body
	        - Not rejected by immune system
	    - Insulin produced is pure
	    - Higher product yield, due to…
	        - Many copies of DNA encoding human insulin are present
	        - Bacteria growth rate is high
	        - Bacterial culture continuously produces insulin
	    - Low extraction cost
C. Genetically modified organisms (GMO)
	- Organisms whose genetic make-up has been altered by genetic engineering
	- Examples:
	    - Glowing GM zebra fish
	    - Pest-resistant GM maize plants
	        - Bacterium has toxin gene that produces toxin which kills pests (e.g. caterpillar)
		- Using recombinant DNA technology
		    1. Obtain toxin gene from toxin-producing bacterium and plasmid from *Agrobacterium*
		    2. Cut with same restriction enzyme
		    3. Ligation of DNA fragment and plasmid
		    4. Introduce plasmid into *Agrobacterium*
		    5. Infect maize cell
		    6. Cell develops into adult plant

		GM maize plant is therefore pest-resistant

	    - New genes/products in GM food may cause allergic reactions
    	- Antibiotic resistance genes may be unintentionally transferred to pathogens
        	- Creating superbugs which are resistant to multiple antibiotics
        	    - Outbreak of incurable diseases (using antibiotics)
        - GMOs transfer genes to wild types
       	    - Genetic pollution
       	    - Unexpected and dangerous effects
        - GMOs may out-compete wild types if released into environment
            - Reduce biodiversity
            - Upset ecological balance
D. Cloning
	- Definition: Genetically identical copy

            - Preserve desirable characters
            - Overcome reproductive difficulties of plants/animals
        - Disadvantage

E. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
	- Allows rapid gene amplification *without living cells*
	- Principle:
	    - DNA + reagents (nucleotides, heat-stable DNA, polymerase and primers)
	    - Cycles of heating and cooling
	    - Imitate natural DNA replication
	- Steps (can be performed in *thermal cycler*)
	    - DNA denaturation (heated to ~95 °C)
	        - Hydrogen bonds break
        	- Double helix DNA sample unravel into two single-stranded DNA
    	- Annealing of primers (cooled to 50-65 °C)
            - Primers (x2) introduced as starting points for DNA synthesis
            	- Specific
            	- Bind to opposite strands
            	- Complementary to DNA strand
        - DNA synthesis (raised to ~70 °C, i.e. optimum temperature)
            - Heat-stable DNA polymerase attach to strand
                - Similar to ribosome
            - Nucleotides introduced
            - Nucleotides bind to original DNA strands
            - New DNA strands are synthesized
        - DNA number doubles each cycle
    - Applications
        - Amplify DNA from foetal cells extracted from amniotic fluid
            - Prenatal (pre-birth) diagnosis of genetic diseases
        - Amplify DNA from samples found in crime scene for DNA fingerprinting
        - Amplify DNA from remains of historical figures/extinct species for study
        - Diagnose infectious diseases
            - PCR is highly sensitive
                - Trace amounts of bacterial/viral DNA in blood can be detected
F. DNA fingerprinting
	- Principle
	    - ~99.9% of base sequence in DNA is same in all humans
	        - Remaining 0.1% represents genetic variations between individuals
	        - Some occur in variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
	            - Present at many different loci on chromosomes
	            - Repetitive base sequences
	            - At a given locus, number of repeats varies greatly per individual between homologous chromosomes
	            - Based on variations in length of VNTRs
	                - DNA fingerprinting can be used to identify individuals
	- Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis [Gel electrophoresis]
	    1. Add restriction enzymes to DNA samples and incubated
	        - DNA fragments produced with some having VNTRs
	    2. Place fragments (bands) on the end of gel slab connected to negative electrode
	        - DNA fragments are negatively-charged
	            - Travel towards positive electrodes
	        - DNA fragments denatured into single-strands and transferred to nylon membrane
	        - Submerge nylon membrane into radioactive DNA probe
	            - Radioactive DNA probe
	                - Short single-stranded DNA fragment complementary to target sequence
                	- Binds only to DNA fragments containing specific VNTRs
            	- Visualize DNA fingerprints using photographic film
                	- Positions of bands determined by number of repeats in VNTRs
		- Longer bands travel less distance compared to shorter ones
		- To avoid identical DNA fingerprints
		    - VNTRs at 4-5 different loci on different chromosomes are used
        		- Unique to each individual
	- Disadvantages of RFLP
	    - Time-consuming
	    - Requires a relatively large amount of good quality (intact) DNA
	        - Led to PCR-based methods
	- Applications
            - Forensic science
            	- Provide evidence on identities of individuals in court cases
    	    - Parentage tests
        	    - Establish family relationships
    	    - Victim identification
    	    - Authentication of Chinese medicine
    	    - Conservation of endangered species
            	- Identify origin of ivory products to help combat illegal hunting
