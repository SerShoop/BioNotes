Ch 21 Photosynthesis

1. Basic Concepts of photosynthesis
    - The process by which organic substances (i.e. carbohydrates) are made from simple inorganic substances (i.e. CO2, H2O) using light energy
    - Light energy captured by chlorophyll
    - Chlorophyll in chloroplasts
    - Light energy -> Chemical energy (stored in carbohydrates)
    - Main product: Carbohydrates
      By-product: Oxygen
    - Anabolic process
    - Proteins and lipids made from intermediates of photosynthetic reactions
        * Requires minerals from soil
        
2. Adaptive features for photosynthesis
    a. Leaves
        i. Leaf blade
            - Broad and flat
                * Provides large surface area for absorbing sunlight
            - Thin
                * Gases and light can reach the photosynthetic cells easily (Minimize distance/Maximize penetration)
        ii. Palisade mesophyll
            - Tightly packed cells that contain many chloroplasts
            - Located on upper side of leaf
                * Allows effective absorption of sunlight
        iii. Spongy mesophyll
            - Loosely packed cells with many air spaces
            - Contains chloroplasts (fewer than palisade mesophyll)
        iv. Upper/Lower epidermis
            - Covered by thin layer of waxy cuticle
                * Reduce water loss from leaf -> Water kept inside for photosynthesis and keeping turgidity
            - Numerous stomata & each stoma surrounded by pair of guard cell
                * When conditions favorable: Open stomata for passage of gases & water
                  When conditions unfavorable: Close stomata to conserve water
        v. Midrib and veins
            - Vascular bundles (xylem + phloem)
                * Effective transport of materials to/away from leaf
                * Support and spread leaf blade
    b. Chloroplasts
        i. Double membrane and stroma
            - Bounded by double membrane and filled with stroma (jelly-like fluid)
            - Stroma contains enzymes
            - Holds starch grains
        ii. Thylakoids
            - Network of disc-like membranous sacs
            - Suspended in stroma
            - Chlorophyll located on thylakoid membranes
            - Arranged in stacks called grana (sing. granum)
        iii. Grana
            - ~50 grana per chloroplast
            - ~50 thylakoids per grana
                * Increase surface area to pack chlorophyll for light absorption
            - Grana interconnected by extensions from thylakoids
                * Efficient transport of photosynthetic products within chloroplast
3. Requirements of photosynthesis
    i. Detection of occurrence of photosynthesis
        - Iodine test
            * Tests for presence of starch
        - Glowing splint test
            *Tests for oxygen produced by plant
    ii. Investigation of requirements
        - Destarching
            *Removes any starch originally present in leaves
            - Place plant in dark for >= 24 hrs
        a. Chlorophyll
            *Use variegated leaves
            - Chlorophyll absent in non-green plants
            - Experimental set-up: With chlorophyll
            - Control: Without chlorophyll
        b. CO2
            * Use potassium hydroxide to remove CO2 from air in control set-up
            - Experimental: Exposure to normal air
            - Control: Exposure to air without CO2
        c. Light
            * Black paper/ aluminium foil to mask part of leaf
            - Experimental: Unmasked part of leaf
            - Control: Masked part of leaf
4. Process of photosynthesis
    i. Photochemical reactions
        a. Light absorption
            - Chlorophyll in thylakoid captures light energy
                -> Some electrons in chlorophyll raised to higher energy level (excited) and emitted from molecule
            - Excited electrons pass through series of electron carriers of decreasing energy levels in the thylakoid membrane (Electron transport chain)
                -> Energy released step-wise manner
