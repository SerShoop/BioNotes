Ch 21 Photosynthesis

1. Basic Concepts of photosynthesis
    - The process by which organic substances (i.e. carbohydrates) are made from simple inorganic substances (i.e. CO2, H2O) using light energy
    - Light energy captured by chlorophyll
    - Chlorophyll in chloroplasts
    - Light energy -> Chemical energy (stored in carbohydrates)
    - Main product: Carbohydrates
      By-product: Oxygen
    - Anabolic process
    - Proteins and lipids made from intermediates of photosynthetic reactions
        * Requires minerals from soil
        
2. Adaptive features for photosynthesis
    a. Leaves
        i. Leaf blade
            - Broad and flat
                * Provides large surface area for absorbing sunlight
            - Thin
                * Gases and light can reach the photosynthetic cells easily (Minimize distance/Maximize penetration)
        ii. Palisade mesophyll
            - Tightly packed cells that contain many chloroplasts
            - Located on upper side of leaf
                * Allows effective absorption of sunlight
        iii. Spongy mesophyll
            - Loosely packed cells with many air spaces
            - Contains chloroplasts (fewer than palisade mesophyll)
        iv. Upper/Lower epidermis
            - Covered by thin layer of waxy cuticle
                * Reduce water loss from leaf -> Water kept inside for photosynthesis and keeping turgidity
            - Numerous stomata & each stoma surrounded by pair of guard cell
                * When conditions favorable: Open stomata for passage of gases & water
                  When conditions unfavorable: Close stomata to conserve water
        v. Midrib and veins
            - Vascular bundles (xylem + phloem)
                * Effective transport of materials to/away from leaf
                * Support and spread leaf blade
    b. Chloroplasts
        i. Double membrane and stroma
            - Bounded by double membrane and filled with stroma (jelly-like fluid)
            - Stroma contains enzymes
            - Holds starch grains
        ii. Thylakoids
            - Network of disc-like membranous sacs
            - Suspended in stroma
            - Chlorophyll located on thylakoid membranes
            - Arranged in stacks called grana (sing. granum)
        iii. Grana
            - ~50 grana per chloroplast
            - ~50 thylakoids per grana
                * Increase surface area to pack chlorophyll for light absorption
            - Grana interconnected by extensions from thylakoids
                * Efficient transport of photosynthetic products within chloroplast
3. Requirements of photosynthesis
    i. Detection of occurrence of photosynthesis
        - Iodine test
            * Tests for presence of starch
        - Glowing splint test
            *Tests for oxygen produced by plant
    ii. Investigation of requirements
        - Destarching
            *Removes any starch originally present in leaves
            - Place plant in dark for >= 24 hrs
        a. Chlorophyll
            *Use variegated leaves
            - Chlorophyll absent in non-green plants
            - Experimental set-up: With chlorophyll
            - Control: Without chlorophyll
        b. CO2
            * Use potassium hydroxide to remove CO2 from air in control set-up
            - Experimental: Exposure to normal air
            - Control: Exposure to air without CO2
        c. Light
            * Black paper/ aluminium foil to mask part of leaf
            - Experimental: Unmasked part of leaf
            - Control: Masked part of leaf
4. Process of photosynthesis
    i. Photochemical reactions
        a. Light absorption
            - Chlorophyll in thylakoid captures light energy
                -> Some electrons in chlorophyll raised to higher energy level (excited) and emitted from molecule
            - Excited electrons pass through series of electron carriers of decreasing energy levels in the thylakoid membrane (Electron transport chain)
                -> Energy released step-wise manner
        b. ATP synthesis
            - ADP + phosphate -> ATP (Photophosphorylation)
            - Light energy captured -> Chemical energy stored in ATP
            - Occurs at thylakoid membrane
        c. Photolysis of water
            - Split water molecules to H and O
            - Hydrogen:
                * Accepted by NADP (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate)
                * Reduction of NADP to NADPH
                * NADPH acts as reducing agent by donating H in carbon fixation
            - Oxygen
                * By-product, released as gas to atmosphere
    ii. Carbon fixation: Calvin cycle
        a. CO2 fixation and formation of 3-C compound
            - CO2 combine with 5-C compound (CO2 acceptor) -> 2x 3-C compound
        b. Reduction of 3-C compund and formation of glucose
            - Energy from ATP and H from NADPH -> Reduce 3-C to triose phosphate (3-C)
            - Two molecules of triose phosphate combine -> Glucose (6-C)
            - Regeneration of CO2 acceptor
                * Most triose phosphate molecules are used to regen. original 5-C CO2 acceptor
                    ^ Triose phosphate -> 5-C compound (Energy from ATP needed: ATP -> ADP + P)
5. Factors affecting rate of photosynthesis
    i. Light intensity
        a. Initially: Rate increases proportionately with light intensity
            - More energy supplied to supplied to photochemical reactions
        b. Further increase: Rate levels off
            - Light intensity reaches a saturation point
            - Limited by other factors
            - Saturation point: Optimum light intensity
    ii. CO2 concentration
        a. Initially: Rate increases proportionately with concentration
            - More substrates supplied to Calvin cycle
        b. Further increase: Rate levels off
            - Limited by other factors
    iii. Identification of limiting factor (x-axis: Light intensity)
        - Low conc. of CO2 level off: Limited by factor other than light intensity
            * If at high conc. of CO2, graph does not level off: CO2 conc. is limiting factor
        - High conc. of CO2 level off: Limited by factor other than CO2 conc.
6. Regulation of rate of photosynthesis
    a. Greenhouse
        - Monitor temperature, light intensity and CO2 conc. for regulation
            * Productivity and quality improved
7. Fate of products
    - Primary product: Triose phosphate
    a. Glucose
        ^ Triose phosphate -> glucose
        - Used in photosynthesizing cells as energy source
        - Most built into starch for storage
            * Insoluble -> Does not affect water potential
        - Broken down to form sucrose
            * Soluble but relatively inactive
        - Built into cellulose for cell walls
