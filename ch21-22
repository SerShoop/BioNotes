Ch 21 Photosynthesis

1. Basic Concepts of photosynthesis
    - The process by which organic substances (i.e. carbohydrates) are made from simple inorganic substances (i.e. CO2, H2O) using light energy
    - Light energy captured by chlorophyll
    - Chlorophyll in chloroplasts
    - Light energy -> Chemical energy (stored in carbohydrates)
    - Main product: Carbohydrates
      By-product: Oxygen
    - Anabolic process
    - Proteins and lipids made from intermediates of photosynthetic reactions
        * Requires minerals from soil
        
2. Adaptive features for photosynthesis
    a. Leaves
        i. Leaf blade
            - Broad and flat
                * Provides large surface area for absorbing sunlight
            - Thin
                * Gases and light can reach the photosynthetic cells easily (Minimize distance/Maximize penetration)
        ii. Palisade mesophyll
