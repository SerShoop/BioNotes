## 1. Genetic code

Base sequence of DNA determines amino sequence in polypeptide (genetic code)

Three consecutive bases code for one amino acid (triplet code)
-	64 variations
-	20 amino acids

Some code for same amino acid signal
-	Degenerate since different code produce same signal
-	Some are start/end signals
-	No gaps/overlapping when reading triplet codes
-	Genetic code is universal

## 2. Protein Synthesis
Gene expression: Decoding of genetic information in gene to make a protein 
### a.	Transcription  
In nucleus  
i.	Break weak H-bonds, DNA strands unwind  
ii.	1 DNA strand acts as template (template strand), other called coding strand  
iii.	Ribonucleotides attracted to template strand through complementary base pairing  
iv.	RNA polymerase catalyses the joining of the adjacent nucleotides to form mRNA.  
v.	Every three bases complementary to the triplet code on DNA is called codon  
vi.	Same as coding strand except having U instead of T  
vii.	mRNA separates from the template strand of DNA  
viii.	Leaves nucleus through the pore on nuclear membrane and enters cytoplasm  
### b.	Translation  
Occurs in cytoplasm where ribosomes (mostly from rough ER) are located  
i.	mRNA produced in transcription attaches to ribosome  
ii.	Free amino acids join to specific transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules in cytoplasm  
1.	tRNA has anticodons that consist of three ribonucleotides. Each anticodon specifies a particular amino acid.  
iii.	tRNA molecule with anticodon complementary to the start codon on mRNA binds to mRNA, carrying a specific amino acid to the ribosome.  
iv.	Another tRNA molecule carrying an amino acid binds to the next codon. Both amino acids are joined by a peptide bond  
v.	Ribosome moves to the next codon and another amino acid is added to the dipeptide.  
vi.	First tRNA released  
vii.	Repeat until stop codon is met.  
viii.	Release polypeptide from ribosome  
	
-	A ribosome can move along a mRNA molecule repeatedly for synthesis of a number of
	polypeptides
-	More than one ribosome can move along the same mRNA molecule simultaneously.  
	Large amounts of polypeptides can thus be made in a short period of time.  
	Polypeptides coil and fold, and may bind with other polypeptides to form proteins.

Proteins (Rough ER):      
- 	 Secreted from cell (digestive enzyme/hormones)
-	 Embedded in cell membrane (carrier/channel proteins)
	Proteins (Free-floating ribosome): Remain in cytoplasm.
-	Usually used by cell itself
-	Serve as enzymes to catalyze reactions within cell 
Mutations
-	Sudden permanent change(s) in DNA of organism
#### 1.	Gene mutation
Changes in base sequence of DNA in gene
a.	Deletion  
-	Loss of base(s) from coding strand (ATG CAT G → ATG ATG)
b.	Insertion  
-	Addition of base(s) into coding strand (ATG CAT → ATG GCA T)

	Deletion or Insertion in a number that is not a multiple of three will shift reading 
	frame (grouping of bases). Therefore the amino acid sequence after the point of
	mutation is altered. Resulting protein is usually non-functional.

c.	Substitution  
-	Change of base(s) to another base per affected base in coding strand (CAT → TAT)
d.	Inversion  
-	Alter sequence of coding strand (CAT → ACT)  
	Substitution and Inversion of bases usually leads to change of one triplet code only.  
	This may result in a different amino acid in the polypeptide.  
	Sufficient alteration of protein by the amino acid will have an obvious effect on the
	phenotype. 

	Example:  
	Sickle-cell anaemia (Substitution)  
	
	
||Normal	|Sickle cell anaemia|
|--------|------------:|--------------:|
|DNA template|	… CTT ...|	… CAT ...|
|mRNA|	… GAA ...|	… GUA ...|
|Polypeptide|	Glutamic acid (Glu)|	Valine (Val)|

This change greatly affects shape and subsequently properties of haemoglobin
	
When oxygen levels are low, the abnormal haemoglobin molecules for long fibres,  
Causing red blood cells to become sickle-shaped.
	
These sickle-shaped cells can block blood vessels, causing damage.  
[Stem cell/bone marrow transplant is the only cure as of time of writing]  
[Anaemia is a decrease in total amount of RBCs/haemoglobin in blood, or lower ability to carry oxygen.]  
	


#### 2.	Chromosome mutations
a.	Change in chromosome structure

Error during crossing over in process → Change in chromosome structure

i. Deletion
-	Segment of chromosome is loss → Loss of genes
-	ABCDEFGH → ABFGH (CDE lost from crossing over)
ii. Duplication
-	Segment of chromosome is repeated → Gain of genes
-	ABCDEFGH → ABCDCDEFGH (CD gained from crossing over)
iii. Inversion
-	Broken segment of chromosome is reinserted in wrong direction → Order of genes reversed
-	ABCDEFGH → ABCEDFGH (DE reinserted in wrong direction, becoming ED)
iv. Translocation
-	Segments of chromosomes exchanged between non-homologous chromosomes → Genes exchanged between said chromosomes
-	ABCDEFGH → ABCDESTU
PQRSTU → PQRFGH



b.	Change in chromosome number
i.	Down syndrome
-	Additional chromosome 21 in body cells
-	47 chromosomes in cell
-	During meiosis, chromosome 21 fails to separate.
-	Some of the gametes have and extra chromosome 21
-	Some do not have chromosome 21
-	If abnormal gene fuses with normal gamete, a zygote with three chromosome 21 will be formed
-	Down syndrome characteristics
-	Shorter than average
-	Distinctive round face
-	Smaller ears
-	Some degree of mental retardation
-	Risk increases with mother’s age


3.	Cause of mutations
a.	Spontaneous mutations
i.	Occur naturally and randomly
ii.	Occur at very low rate

b.	Induced mutations
i.	Induced by agents called mutagens
ii.	Chemical
-	Nitrous acid (Food preservatives)
-	Tar (Smoking)
-	Asbestos (Construction materials)
-	Mustard gas (Chemical warfare)

			Changes chemical structure of DNA
-	 Nitrous acid changes base of DNA into another (Gene mutation)
-	Some chemicals insert themselves between bases and cause errors in DNA replication

iii.	Radiation
-	Ultraviolet light (Sunlight)
-	X-rays (Medical examination)
-	Gamma rays (Radiotherapy, nukes)

			Ionizes water/other molecules to form free radicals
-	Free radicals are highly reactive
-	Damages DNA molecules
4.	Effects of mutations
a.	Harmful
i.	Usually the case
ii.	Mutations lead to change in shape of protein
-	Protein cannot function properly
-	Leads to diseases/death
b.	No effect
Most gene mutations have no effect on organisms
-	Mutations (substitution/inversion) may produce same amino acid with a different code (degenerative nature of genetic code)
-	Changes in an amino acid may not alter shape of protein
-	Alleles exist in pairs. Mutations of one allele may be masked by its normal counterpart
c.	Beneficial
i.	Mutations occurring in gamete/gamete-producing cells are inheritable
ii.	Source of variations in a population
-	Give rise to new characters that are favourable in certain environments
iii.	Such variations are essential for natural selection to work and bring about evolution.
